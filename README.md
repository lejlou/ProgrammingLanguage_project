## Project description

Our task for this project is to code an implementation of the popular game “4-in-a-Row”, in the language GO.
The project was done as part of the IT 305 Programming Languages course at International Burch University, and implemented in the Go programming language.


## GO Programming Language - GOLANG 

GO is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software. Go was developed by Google engineers to create dependable and efficient software. Go is statically typed and explicit. Some examples of organizations that use Go include Google, Cloudflare, Dropbox, MongoDB, Netflix, SoundCloud, Twitch and Uber.

Main characteristics: 
- Open-Source
- Static Typing 
- Concurrency Support
- Powerful Standard Library and Tool Set 
- Testing Capabilities 
- Garbage Collection 

## "4 in a row" game 

4 in a row is a two-player board game, in which the players take turns dropping colored discs into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.

## Run the code 

To run the project, you will first need to install Go on your machine. We used this link (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etSN4X_fCnM) for instructions how to setup Go language. 

Run the game following these steps:
